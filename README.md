# recipe app

A Flutter app for mobile app development. 
Created by Blake Caraballo & Daiane Gomes

## Getting Started
When you first open the application you are greeted with an introduction page telling you about the app. You begin by clicking 'Explore'.
Once you hit the 'Explore' button, you can check out some recipes we have provided in the app. Click on a recipe to see ingredients and instructions on how to prepare the dish. You can filter the recipes by diet and ingredients. 
Once you have found a recipe you want to make you can "like" the recipe and save it to "my recipes" and/or add it to your meal planner by clicking a day of the month and typing the name of the recipe. Liking the recipe adds the ingredients to your grocey list. Another way to add ingredients to your grocey list is to type the name of the recipe you want to make into your meal planner and it will automatically add the ingredients to your grocery list.
