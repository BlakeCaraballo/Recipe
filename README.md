## Getting Started
When you first open the application you are greeted with a introduction page telling you about the app. You begin by clicking 'Get Started'.
You can check out some recipes we have provided in the app. Click on a recipe to see ingredients and instructions on how to prepare the dish.
once you have found a recipe you want to make you can "like" the recipe and save it to "your recipes" and/or add it to your meal planner by clicking a day of the month and typing the name of the recipe. Once you type the name of the recipe the ingredients of that recipe are added to your grocery list.
